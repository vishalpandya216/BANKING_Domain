# Banking_Domain
Project Description:

Objective: The project aims to predict a target variable using various banking-related features.

Data Preparation: Merging multiple datasets including geo_scores, instance data, and qset_tats with the main dataset. Handling missing values and data imbalance.

Modeling: Logistic regression models were applied. Initial modeling on the imbalanced dataset showed poor recall, which was improved by balancing the dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Evaluation: The model performance was evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score. The balanced dataset model showed better recall and overall performance.
